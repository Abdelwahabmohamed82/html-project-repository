<p>ROLE OF WORLD HEALTH ORGNISATION</p>

<P>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines Global public health security as “the activities required to minimize the danger and impact of acute public health events that endanger the collective health of populations living across geographical regions and international boundaries.” Has WHO been successful in doing its best to deliver suitable and evidence-based response measures to deal with this global public health threat? WHO is blamed for its negligence to cover up China’s failure to handle the crisis. Besides, it is not equipped with the essential authority to effectively accomplish its mission. Adequate global health can’t be achieved simply with high-level coordination. It requires a responsive system of governance supported by global political cooperation. However, WHO has been striving for mitigating global health security risks during the pandemic through containing emergence and spread of COVID-19, providing technical guidance on it, working in collaboration with scientists, business, and global health organizations to speed up the pandemic response and giving advice for international travel and trade in relation to the outbreak to stop disease to spread</P>
